The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.

    Roll the die for the user (generate a Random number between 1 – 6) and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s the code to do this ((import is java.util.Random):

    Random random = new Random();
    int die = random.nextInt(6) + 1;

    After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.

    Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.

    However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they’ve won.

    If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.

    Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board, so a message like “You advanced to space 22” is a bug.
