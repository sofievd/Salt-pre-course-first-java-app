    Your optional exercise for this chapter is to create an abstract class called Animal, which declares an abstract method called makeSound(), and implements a non-abstract method called eat().

    Then create a Pig class and a Duck class that both extend the Animal class.

    Finally, create a Farm class to test these implementations.
