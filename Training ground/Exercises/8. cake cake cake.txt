    The first one is going to be a superclass called Cake and it will have two fields, flavor and price. Go ahead and make getter and setter methods for both of these fields.

    Next create a BirthdayCake class which will inherit from the Cake class and it has a field of its own called candles. Go ahead and include the getter and setter method for candles.

    And then create a third class called WeddingCake which also inherits from Cake and has a field called tiers and you'll include a getter and setter method for this.

    And then finally, a class called TasteTester which will test out your inheritance.

Good luck.
