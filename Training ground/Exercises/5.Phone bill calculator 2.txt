So, a phone bill should have an ID, a base class, a number of allotted minutes and a number of minutes used. And then, it should also be able to calculate the overage, calculate the tax, and calculate the total.

And then, it should also be able to print an itemized bill.

You should also include three constructors

    a default one
    one that accepts the ID only
    one that accepts all fields

Now no matter which of these constructors you use, all fields should be set eventually.

Then you can also create a different class that instantiates the PhoneBill and prints out an itemized bill.

Good luck.
